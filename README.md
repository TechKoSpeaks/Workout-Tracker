## Description 

<br/>

This application is a NoSQL based workout app that allows users to input workout and exercise criteria, and then have these exercises and workouts saved for workout reference. Specific workouts are separated in two categories, training and cardio. The names, length and duration of the workouts are defined by the user, and then stored in a MongoDB database. [`MongoDB`](https://www.mongodb.com/) Totals are then calculated from each workout, with the most recent workout listed on the main page, and prior workouts from the week are listed on the dashboard page (/stats).

## Usage

<br />


<strong>Instructions:</strong>

<br>


In a browser window, navigate to:‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‏‏[`Workout Tracker`](https://).‏‏‎ ‎ Upon loading the home page, it will display any current workout statistic, and list options for continuing the workout or starting a new workout. 

When current workout is clicked, options will list for either a resistance or cardio based workout, and the user is given options to input the name, details and duration of the workout (Example: Cardio Training: Bench Press, 200 pounds, 10 sets, 10 reps, 20 minutes).

When new workout is clicked, the user will be prompted to start a new workout with options for resistance or cardio training, and can input these statistics appropriately.

When the user navigates to the dashboard page (/stats page) an aggregate chart will present with all of the workout statistics throughout the days of the week.
